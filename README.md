# Description

This is a Command Line Interface application that can create an organization tree for a user's organization. It creates simple but well organized cards to show a team profile. This application has taught me how to use node.js to an advanced level and challenged me to use jest to continuously check my codes and make sure I meet the requirements for each phase.

# Systems Used

The following necessary dependencies must be installed to run the application properly:

dependencies: inquirer

devDependencies: jest
